# ODA_Analysis

Independent analysis of **Official Development Assistance (ODA)** effectiveness (2000–2023).  
This project explores how **education** and **health** aid relate to **literacy**, **life expectancy**, and **infant mortality**,  
highlighting cross-sector connections in human development and social investment outcomes.  
The findings aim to inform evidence-based policy design and sustainable development strategy.

## 📘 Project Overview
Do countries that invest more in education and health host better human development outcomes?  
Using open datasets from **OECD DAC2A** and **World Bank WDI**, this project applies reproducible R-based analytics  
to examine how sectoral ODA aligns with long-term improvements in literacy, health, and well-being.

## 📊 About the Data
The analysis integrates ODA disbursement data (OECD DAC2A) with human development indicators (WDI)  
for selected developing countries from **2000 to 2023**.

### Data Sources
- **OECD DAC2A – Creditor Reporting System (CRS):**  
  Aggregate ODA disbursements by donor and recipient (constant USD).  
  🔗 [https://data-explorer.oecd.org/](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/)  
  *(Dataset: “Aid (ODA) disbursements to countries and regions (DAC2A)”)*

- **World Bank – World Development Indicators (WDI):**  
  Literacy rate, life expectancy, infant mortality, and school enrollment.  
  🔗 [https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)

- **World Bank – Population and Income Data:**  
  Country-level population and income group classification (Low → High income).

## ⚙️ Data Processing
- Data merged and cleaned using **R (tidyverse)** and **Power Query**.  
- Indicators normalized by year and income group.  
- Lag variables (1–3 years) applied to capture delayed effects of ODA.  
- Growth rates and mismatch indicators computed using **DAX** and **tidyverse**.

---

## 🎯 Analytical Goals
- Evaluate ODA allocation efficiency by **sector** and **income group**.  
- Assess long-term **literacy** and **health** improvements.  
- Identify mismatches between ODA inflows and observed progress.  
- Support data-driven, cross-sectoral policy design through the **Education–Health Nexus** framework.

📈 Key Findings
Education ODA shows a positive correlation with literacy rate (Pearson r ≈ +0.65).
Health ODA is moderately linked to life expectancy (r ≈ +0.58).
Combined education–health models explain development variance better than single-sector models.
Several middle-income countries show a mismatch between high ODA inflows and slower outcome growth.
