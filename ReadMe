# ODA_Analysis

Independent analysis of Official Development Assistance (ODA) effectiveness, 2000–2023.  
Uses OECD DAC2A and World Bank WDI data to explore how education and health investments influence literacy, life expectancy, and infant mortality, highlighting cross-sector connectivity in human development.  
Includes R scripts, RMarkdown, and a PDF report with fully reproducible analysis.

## About the Data
This project investigates Official Development Assistance (ODA) and key human development indicators across selected developing countries from 2000 to 2023.  
The purpose is to assess how education and health sector aid interact to shape literacy, life expectancy, and infant mortality outcomes.

### Data Sources
- **OECD DAC2A – Creditor Reporting System (CRS):**  
  Aggregate ODA disbursements by donor and recipient in constant USD.  
  Data extracted from the OECD Data Explorer:  
  🔗 [https://data-explorer.oecd.org/](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/)  
  *(Dataset: “Aid (ODA) disbursements to countries and regions (DAC2A)”)*

- **World Bank – World Development Indicators (WDI):**  
  Literacy rate, life expectancy, infant mortality, and school enrollment.  
  Data obtained from the World Bank DataBank:  
  🔗 [https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)

- **World Bank – Population and Income Data:**  
  Country-level population size and income group classification (Low, Lower-middle, Upper-middle, High income).  
  Data available from:  
  🔗 [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

### Data Processing
- Data merged and cleaned in **Power Query** and **R**.  
- Indicators normalized by year and income group.  
- Lag variables (1–3 years) applied to capture delayed effects of ODA on literacy and life expectancy.  
- Averages, growth rates, and mismatch indicators computed using **DAX** and **tidyverse**.  

### Dashboard & Analytical Goals
- Evaluate ODA allocation efficiency by **sector** and **income group**.  
- Assess long-term human development improvements.  
- Identify mismatches between ODA inflows and outcome trends.  
- Support data-driven, integrated ODA decision making through the **Education–Health Nexus** framework.
